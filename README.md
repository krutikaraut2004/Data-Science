### Key Components:
- Data cleaning and handling missing values.
- Feature engineering and selection.
- Outlier detection and removal.
- Model evaluation and fine-tuning.

## 3) Naive Bayes Application

### Overview:
Used Gaussian Naive Bayes for Titanic survival prediction, applying a probabilistic model that assumes features are normally distributed. Leveraged Bayes' theorem to calculate probabilities and make predictions, making it a useful tool for binary classification tasks.

### Key Components:
- Data preprocessing and feature selection.
- Gaussian Naive Bayes model implementation.
- Evaluation of model performance.

## 4) Web Scraping

### Overview:
Web scraping project utilizing the pandas library to extract table data of National Basketball Association (NBA) player statistics. The project aims to gather relevant information from NBA websites and organize it into a structured format using pandas, facilitating easy analysis and manipulation of player stats data.

### Key Components:
- Web scraping techniques using Python.
- Data extraction and transformation with pandas.
- Data organization and analysis.

## 5) Logistic Regression

### Overview:
Logistic regression employed for both binary and multi-class classification objectives. The binary classification aspect focused on predicting outcomes in a two-class system, while the multi-class component extended the model's capabilities to handle scenarios with more than two classes.

### Key Components:
- Data preprocessing for classification tasks.
- Model training and evaluation for binary and multi-class scenarios.
- Interpretation and analysis of model results.

## 5) Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

The sentiment analysis of movie reviews involves the examination of textual content to categorize opinions as positive, negative, or neutral. By applying machine learning and natural language processing techniques, the goal is to understand audience sentiment towards a particular movie.

### Key Components:
- Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Feature Extraction and Engineering
- Model Training
- Evaluation and Visualization
