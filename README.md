1) Linear Regression Model Applications : Implemented linear regression models on the Diabetes and Boston Housing datasets to analyze relationships and predict outcomes. Explored correlations between variables and derived insights for both medical and housing contexts.
2) Price Prediction : Developed a home price prediction model involving data cleaning, feature engineering, and outlier removal. Implemented a robust model-building process to enhance accuracy and reliability in forecasting property prices.
3) Naive Bayes Application : Using Gaussian Naive Bayes for Titanic survival prediction involves applying a probabilistic model that assumes features are normally distributed.The model leverages Bayes' theorem to calculate probabilities and make predictions, making it a useful tool for binary classification tasks like predicting whether a passenger survived or not on the Titanic.
