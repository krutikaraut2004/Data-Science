1) Linear Regression Model Applications : Implemented linear regression models on the Diabetes and Boston Housing datasets to analyze relationships and predict outcomes. Explored correlations between variables and derived insights for both medical and housing contexts.
2) Price Prediction : Developed a home price prediction model involving data cleaning, feature engineering, and outlier removal. Implemented a robust model-building process to enhance accuracy and reliability in forecasting property prices.
3) Naive Bayes Application : Using Gaussian Naive Bayes for Titanic survival prediction involves applying a probabilistic model that assumes features are normally distributed.The model leverages Bayes' theorem to calculate probabilities and make predictions, making it a useful tool for binary classification tasks like predicting whether a passenger survived or not on the Titanic.
4) Web Scraping : This web scraping project utilizes the pandas library to extract table data of National Basketball Association (NBA) player statistics. By leveraging web scraping techniques, the project aims to gather relevant information from NBA websites and organize it into a structured format using pandas, facilitating easy analysis and manipulation of player stats data.
5) Logistic Regression : In this project, logistic regression was employed to address both binary and multi-class classification objectives. The binary classification aspect focused on predicting outcomes in a two-class system, while the multi-class component extended the model's capabilities to handle scenarios with more than two classes. The project encompassed various stages, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation, highlighting the effectiveness and versatility of logistic regression in tackling diverse classification challenges.
